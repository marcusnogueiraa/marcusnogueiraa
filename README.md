# Hi, my name is Marcus!

🙋‍♂️ **Welcome to my GitHub repository! I would like to introduce me:**<br/>
- 👨🏼‍🎓I'm currently graduating in Computer Engineering at the Federal University of Ceará (UFC). (2022 - 2026)
- 🌱 Focusing studies, at the moment, on IoT Programming, Software Engineering, Microservices and Competitive Programming.
- 😄 I currently work as an autonomous freelance developer.

## 💻 **My history in Computing**<br/>
 - I started my studies with Programming in 2016 when playing in Minecraft multiplayer servers, an environment to which I was introduced to the Java Language. At that time, the servers' Mods and Plugins were written in java, I met freelance Plugin Developers who introduced me to the world of programming and provided me with content to study. The following year (2017) at the age of 13, I delved into the development of Bots for Discord using the Python Language, at the time, my knowledge was very limited, I started creating private projects of bots for Music, Puzzles, etc. At the beginning of learning, I only changed ready codes in order to understand them, over time, I studied the language and deepened myself in the studies. In 2022 I got a vacancy at UFC in Computer Engineering and I'm in the computer business until today. At university, I became interested in Competitive Programming, studying subjects such as: Algorithms, Data Structures, Combinatorial Optimization, Computational Geometry, Dynamic Programming and Graph Theory. During my academic journey, I interned at a distance education company helping to teach programming to high school students through game development. In addition, I was a monitor of programming subjects (Fundamentals of Programming, Object Oriented Programming and Data Structure). I was a tutor at the Programming Marathon Study Group (GEMP), teaching Competitive Programming classes to participants in the Brazilian Informatics Olympiad (OBI), a qualifying competition for the International Olympiad in Informatics (IOI). I trained teams and participated in the ICPC Brazil Regionals in 2023 and 2024. I am currently a scholarship holder in the Tutorial Education Program, carrying out Teaching, Research and Extension activities.
