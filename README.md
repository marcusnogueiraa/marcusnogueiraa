# Hi, my name is Marcus!

🙋‍♂️ **Welcome to my GitHub repository! I would like to introduce me:**<br/>
- 👨🏼‍🎓I'm currently graduating in Computer Engineering at the Federal University of Ceará (UFC). (2022 - 2026)
- 🌱 Focusing studies, at the moment, on IoT Programming, Software Engineering and Competitive Programming.
- 😄 I'm currently interning at FDR.

## 💻 **My history in Computing**<br/>
 - I started my studies with Programming in 2016 when playing in Minecraft multiplayer servers, an environment to which I was introduced to the Java Language. At that time, the servers' Mods and Plugins were written in java, I met freelance Plugin Developers who introduced me to the world of programming and provided me with content to study. The following year (2017) at the age of 13, I delved into the development of Bots for Discord using the Python Language, at the time, my knowledge was very limited, I started creating private projects of bots for Music, Puzzles, etc. At the beginning of learning, I only changed ready codes in order to understand them, over time, I studied the language and deepened myself in the studies. In 2022 I got a vacancy at UFC in Computer Engineering and I'm in the computer business until today. At university, I became interested in Competitive Programming, studying subjects such as: Algorithms, Data Structures, Combinatorial Optimization and Graph Theory.
 
## 🍀 **GitHub Contents**<br/>
- Currently, I use my GitHub repository to store projects made in university disciplines and resolutions of challenges using logic and mathematical concepts. I intend to store personal projects soon, such as Bots for Discord, Websites, Automation Scripts, etc..
